        <h1>Personality: Caring</h1>
        <br></br>
        <center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're a caring human being, and that's pretty rare nowadays. People are naturally kind to you because you are kind to them. You have good social skills, but you might not do well in a leadership position. Others may tease you simply because they know you won't hurt them back. This might cause you to become quiet. However, you need to remember that nothing is as important as being a good, moral person, which you obviously are!</p></center>
